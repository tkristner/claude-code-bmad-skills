# Commands Reference

Another Claude-Code BMAD provides **34 slash commands** for managing your agile development workflow. Each command is designed for a specific phase and purpose.

> **Note:** All commands use the `/accbmad:` prefix (e.g., `/accbmad:workflow-init`).

---

## How Commands Work

Commands are markdown files in `~/.claude/commands/accbmad/` that define interactive workflows. When you type a command like `/prd`, Claude Code loads the command definition and guides you through the process.

**Quick tip:** Type `/workflow-status` anytime to see which command to run next.

## Phase 1 - Analysis Commands

<h3 id="product-brief">/product-brief</h3>

Create a comprehensive product brief that defines the problem space, target audience, and business goals.

**When to use:** Starting a new product (Level 1+, required for Level 2+)

**Output:** `accbmad/1-analysis/product-brief.md`

**Prerequisite:** `/workflow-init`

#### Example

```
User: /product-brief

Claude: I'll help create a product brief for Real-time Chat Application.

## Executive Summary

In 2-3 sentences, what does this product do?
> A team collaboration platform focused on real-time communication.
> Combines chat, voice, and video with deep integrations for
> developer tools.

## Problem Statement

What problems does this solve? I'll structure them:

1. **Communication silos:** Teams use multiple apps (Slack, Discord, Teams)
2. **Context switching:** Developers lose focus switching between chat and IDE
3. **Limited customization:** Existing tools have rigid workflows

Is this accurate?
> Yes, also add "Poor code sharing experience"

Added: **Poor code sharing:** Pasting code in chat loses formatting and context

## Target Audience

Primary users:
> Software development teams, 5-50 people
> Tech-forward companies
> Remote-first teams

Secondary users:
> Individual developers in open source communities

## Solution Overview

Based on problems, your solution will:
- Unified chat, voice, video in one app
- IDE extensions (VS Code, JetBrains)
- Rich code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Customizable workflows and bots

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors:
- **Slack:** Market leader, expensive, slow
- **Discord:** Gaming-focused, poor enterprise features
- **Teams:** Microsoft-only, complex

Your differentiation:
> Developer-first experience, superior code handling,
> privacy-focused (self-hostable)

## Business Model

How will you monetize?
> Freemium - free for small teams (<10)
> Pro: $8/user/month
> Enterprise: $15/user/month (SSO, audit logs)

## Success Metrics

How will you measure success?
> - 1000 teams in 6 months
> - 40% weekly active users
> - <200ms message delivery
> - NPS > 50

## Constraints and Risks

Technical constraints:
> - Must support 10k concurrent users
> - End-to-end encryption required

Risks:
> - Slack network effects
> - Feature parity expectations

## Phase 3 - Solutioning Commands

<h3 id="architecture">/architecture</h3>

Design the system architecture including components, data models, APIs, and technology choices.

**When to use:** Level 2+ projects after PRD

**Output:** `accbmad/3-solutioning/architecture.md`

**Prerequisite:** `accbmad/2-planning/prd.md`

#### Example

See the [System Architect skill documentation](../skills/#system-architect) for a complete architecture example.

---

<h3 id="solutioning-gate-check">/solutioning-gate-check</h3>

Validate that the architecture addresses all requirements from the PRD.

**When to use:** After completing architecture, before sprint planning

**Output:** Status display (no file)

**Prerequisites:** `accbmad/2-planning/prd.md`, `accbmad/3-solutioning/architecture.md`

#### Example

```
User: /solutioning-gate-check

Claude: I'll validate your architecture against the PRD.

Loading: accbmad/2-planning/prd.md, accbmad/3-solutioning/architecture.md

## Functional Requirements Check

| FR | Description | Addressed | Notes |
|----|-------------|-----------|-------|
| FR-001 | Authentication | ✓ | Auth service, JWT, OAuth |
| FR-002 | Real-time messaging | ✓ | WebSocket service, Redis |
| FR-003 | Channels/DMs | ✓ | Channel service |
| FR-004 | Code sharing | ✓ | Message service + Prism.js |
| FR-005 | Search | ✓ | Elasticsearch |
| FR-006 | Notifications | ✓ | Push service, FCM |

## Non-Functional Requirements Check

| NFR | Requirement | Solution | Status |
|-----|-------------|----------|--------|
| NFR-001 | <200ms messages | WebSocket + Redis PubSub | ✓ |
| NFR-001 | <500ms search | Elasticsearch | ✓ |
| NFR-002 | E2E encryption | Signal protocol | ✓ |
| NFR-003 | 10k users | Horizontal scaling, sharding | ✓ |
| NFR-004 | 99.9% uptime | Multi-AZ, failover | ✓ |

## Gap Analysis

### Addressed
All functional and non-functional requirements have corresponding
architecture components.

### Potential Concerns

1. **Message ordering:** Architecture mentions "eventual consistency"
   but FR-002 requires strict ordering. Consider:
   - Vector clocks for ordering
   - Single leader per channel

2. **Search latency:** Elasticsearch is specified but indexing
   strategy not detailed. Consider:
   - Index message on write vs. async
   - Partial word matching approach

3. **File attachments:** FR-002 mentions file sharing but
   architecture doesn't specify:
   - Storage solution (S3?)
   - CDN for delivery
   - Virus scanning

### Recommendations

1. Add message ordering strategy to architecture
2. Detail Elasticsearch indexing approach
3. Add file attachment subsystem

## Gate Status: CONDITIONAL PASS

Address the 3 concerns above before proceeding to sprint planning.

Would you like me to help update the architecture document?

## Phase 4 - Implementation Commands

<h3 id="sprint-planning">/sprint-planning</h3>

Break down the PRD into stories and plan sprint iterations.

**When to use:** After architecture is complete

**Output:** `accbmad/4-implementation/sprint.yaml`, `accbmad/4-implementation/stories/*.md`

**Prerequisites:** `accbmad/2-planning/prd.md`, `accbmad/3-solutioning/architecture.md`

#### Example

See the [Scrum Master skill documentation](../skills/#scrum-master) for a complete sprint planning example.

---

<h3 id="create-story">/create-story</h3>

Create a single user story with acceptance criteria and implementation notes.

**When to use:** Need to add a story outside of sprint planning

**Output:** `accbmad/4-implementation/stories/STORY-XXX.md`

#### Example

```
User: /create-story

Claude: I'll help create a new user story.

## Story Details

What epic does this belong to?
> Epic 2: Messaging

Story title:
> Message Reactions

As a (user type):
> team member

I want to:
> add emoji reactions to messages

So that:
> I can quickly acknowledge or respond without typing

## Acceptance Criteria

What conditions must be met?
> - Can add any emoji as reaction
> - Multiple users can add same reaction (shows count)
> - Can remove own reaction
> - Reactions show who added them on hover
> - Real-time updates when others react

## Technical Notes

Any implementation considerations?
> - Store reactions in separate collection
> - Index by messageId
> - Broadcast via WebSocket
> - Limit to 20 unique emojis per message

## Estimation

Story points (Fibonacci: 1,2,3,5,8,13):
> 5

Priority (Must/Should/Could):
> Should

## Story Created

```markdown
# STORY-029: Message Reactions

**Epic:** Messaging
**Points:** 5
**Priority:** Should
**Status:** Pending

## User Story
As a team member, I want to add emoji reactions to messages
so that I can quickly acknowledge or respond without typing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can add any emoji as reaction
- [ ] Multiple users can add same reaction (shows count)
- [ ] Can remove own reaction
- [ ] Reactions show who added them on hover
- [ ] Real-time updates when others react

## Technical Notes

<h3 id="dev-story">/dev-story</h3>

Implement a user story end-to-end with code and tests.

**When to use:** Ready to implement a story

**Argument:** Story ID (e.g., `/dev-story STORY-004`)

**Output:** Code files, updated story status

#### Example

See the [Developer skill documentation](../skills/#developer) for a complete implementation example.

<h3 id="dev-sprint-auto">/dev-sprint-auto</h3>

Autonomous sprint execution - processes all pending stories automatically with integrated code review and git workflow.

**When to use:** You have multiple stories ready and want hands-off development

**Output:** Implemented stories with commits on develop branch

**Prerequisite:** `accbmad/4-implementation/sprint.yaml` with stories marked `pending` or `ready-for-dev`

#### How It Works

The workflow uses a script-driven loop that processes each story through 8 mandatory steps:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  story-queue.sh next → Returns next pending story               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Step 1: git checkout -b story/{id}                             │
│  Step 2: Implement story (all acceptance criteria + tests)      │
│  Step 3: CODE REVIEW (mandatory, auto-fix)                      │
│  Step 4: git commit                                             │
│  Step 5: VERIFICATION REVIEW (post-commit safety check)         │
│  Step 6: git merge to develop                                   │
│  Step 7: Update sprint-status.yaml                              │
│  Step 8: story-queue.sh next → Loop or STOP                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| (none) | All pending stories | `/dev-sprint-auto` |
| `--story ID` | Single specific story | `/dev-sprint-auto --story 2-3` |
| `--max N` | Maximum N stories | `/dev-sprint-auto --max 3` |
| `--dry-run` | Show plan only | `/dev-sprint-auto --dry-run` |

#### HALT Conditions

The workflow stops automatically when:
- No more pending stories (sprint complete)
- Code review fails 3 times on same issues
- Git merge conflict requiring manual resolution

<h3 id="create-epics-stories">/create-epics-stories</h3>

Transform PRD requirements into user-value-focused epics and detailed stories.

**When to use:** After PRD is complete, before sprint planning

**Output:** `docs/epics.md`

**Prerequisite:** `accbmad/2-planning/prd.md`

#### Key Principles

- **User-Value First:** Organize epics by user outcomes, not technical layers
- **Standalone Epics:** Each epic delivers value independently
- **No Future Dependencies:** Stories don't depend on future stories

#### Example

```
User: /create-epics-stories

Claude: Loading PRD... Found 12 functional requirements.

## Epic Design

✅ GOOD: Epic 1 "User Authentication" → Users can login
❌ BAD: Epic 1 "Database Setup" → No user value

Proposed Epic Structure:

| Epic | Title | FRs | User Value |
|------|-------|-----|------------|
| 1 | Authentication | FR-001, FR-002 | Secure access |
| 2 | Product Management | FR-003, FR-004, FR-005 | CRUD products |
| 3 | Sync Engine | FR-006, FR-007, FR-008 | Real-time sync |

Coverage: 12/12 FRs (100%)

[A] Approve and create stories
[R] Revise epics

User: A

Creating stories for Epic 1...

### Story 1.1: User Registration

As a new user,
I want to register with my email,
So that I can access the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
Given I am on the registration page
When I submit a valid email and password
Then my account is created
And I receive a confirmation email
