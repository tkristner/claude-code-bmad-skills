# [Orchestrator] Solutioning Gate Check

You are executing the **Solutioning Gate Check** command (alias for `/check-implementation-readiness`).

## Purpose
Comprehensive validation that all Phase 3 deliverables are complete before starting implementation.

## Execution
1. Load project configuration from `accbmad/config.yaml`
2. Run 5 validation categories:
   - **PRD Completeness**: 9 criteria (all project levels)
   - **Architecture**: 7 criteria (Level 2+ only)
   - **FR→Epic→Story Coverage**: 100% traceability required
   - **Dependency Health**: Cycle detection, valid references
   - **Estimation Completeness**: All stories have points
3. Generate comprehensive readiness report
4. Save to `accbmad/3-solutioning/implementation-readiness-{date}.md`

## Status
- PASS: All categories pass, ready for Sprint 1
- CONDITIONAL: Minor warnings, can proceed with caution
- FAIL: Critical issues must be fixed first

## When to Use
- Before starting Sprint 1
- After completing architecture design
- Before committing significant development resources
- When onboarding new team members
