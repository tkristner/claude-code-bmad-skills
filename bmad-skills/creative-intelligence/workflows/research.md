## Definition of Done

Research is complete when all criteria below are satisfied:

### Coverage Metrics

- [ ] All stated research questions addressed (100%)
- [ ] Each question has ≥2 supporting sources
- [ ] Mix of primary and secondary sources used
- [ ] No critical questions left unanswered without explanation

### Confidence Level Requirements

For each finding, assign and document confidence level:

| Level | Confidence | Evidence Required | Action |
|-------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **High** | 90%+ | 3+ independent sources agree | Ready for decisions |
| **Medium** | 70-89% | 2 sources agree, limited conflict | Ready with caveats |
| **Low** | 50-69% | 1 source or conflicting data | Flag for validation |
| **Insufficient** | <50% | Unable to answer reliably | Requires more research |

### Minimum Confidence Thresholds

- [ ] ≥70% of findings rated Medium or High confidence
- [ ] No critical decisions rely solely on Low confidence findings
- [ ] All Low/Insufficient findings flagged with follow-up plan
- [ ] Key recommendations based only on Medium+ confidence data

### Source Quality

- [ ] All sources cited with accessible URLs
- [ ] Source dates documented (prefer <2 years old for market data)
- [ ] Potential bias in sources acknowledged
- [ ] At least 1 authoritative source per major finding

### Deliverable Completeness

- [ ] Executive summary (≤5 bullet points)
- [ ] Detailed findings by research question
- [ ] Recommendations with priorities (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Research gaps and limitations documented
- [ ] Full source bibliography

### Exit Criteria

Research is actionable when:
1. All key questions answered at Medium+ confidence
2. Uncertainties documented with mitigation plans
3. Clear, prioritized recommendations provided
4. Limitations honestly stated

**Not ready if:**
- Critical questions at Low/Insufficient confidence
- Recommendations not tied to evidence
- Missing source citations

## HALT Conditions

Stop the workflow and notify user if:

| Condition | Message | Recovery |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| No research questions | "Cannot research without defined questions." | Define research scope with user |
| Critical questions unanswerable | "Unable to find reliable data for critical questions." | Flag gaps, recommend alternatives |
| All findings low confidence | "Findings lack reliable sources. Need additional research." | Identify better sources |
| No actionable recommendations | "Research complete but no clear recommendations." | Apply insight synthesis |
